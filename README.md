The build is meant to be build up with a reflow oven / PNP (Pick and Place) or with good soldering techniques.

I do not take any responsibility for any harm that it may cause.
I expect some knowledge of electronics beforehand before building the power bank up.
A LiPo is used in this project that could cause harm.
